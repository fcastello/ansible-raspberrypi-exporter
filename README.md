# raspberrypi_exporter
Prometheus exporter for raspberry pi metrics using prometheus node exporter textfile. This exporter is based on the work from https://github.com/fahlke/raspberrypi_exporter with a couple of modifications to make it work in ubuntu and with options to change default configuration for the text file and where commands are installed.
